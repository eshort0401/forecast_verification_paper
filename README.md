# forecast_verification_paper
This repository contains code I wrote for the study "Verifying Operational Forecasts of Land-Sea Breeze and Boundary Layer Mixing Processes". The code uses the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's "Jive" verification libraries, which can be requested from the Bureau's Evidence Tasked Automation Team or by emailing (shorte1@student.unimelb.edu.au). However, all the methods used from Jive for the study are straightforward, and it shouldn't be too difficult to modify my code to work without Jive. The datasets used in the study are available at (TBD).
