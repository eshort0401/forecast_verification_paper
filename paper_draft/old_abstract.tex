\section{Introduction}
\label{Sec:Introduction}
Forecasts issued by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) are based on automated post-processed model data that is edited by human forecasters. Two types of edits are commonly made to the wind fields. These edits aim to improve how the influences of boundary layer mixing and land-sea breeze processes are represented in the forecast. In this study we compare the diurnally varying component of the BoM's official edited wind forecast, with that of station observations and unedited model datasets, to assess changes to error and bias resulting from these edits. We consider coastal locations across Australia over June, July and August 2018, aggregating data over three spatial scales. The edited forecast generally only produces a lower mean absolute error than model guidance at the coarsest spatial scale (over fifty thousand square kilometres), but can achieve lower seasonal biases over all spatial scales. However, the edited forecast only reduces errors or biases at particular times and locations, and rarely produces lower errors or biases than all model guidance products simultaneously. To better understand the biases in the diurnal wind cycles, we fit modified ellipses to the temporal hodographs of seasonally averaged diurnal wind cycles. Biases in the official forecast diurnal cycle vary with location for multiple reasons, including biases in the directions sea-breezes approach coastlines, amplitude and shape biases in the hodographs, and disagreement as to whether sea-breeze or boundary layer mixing processes contribute most to the diurnal cycle.
