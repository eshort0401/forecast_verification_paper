abstract="A scheme for the representation of the vertical eddy fluxes of heat, momentum and water vapour in a forecast model is presented. An important feature of the scheme is the dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the static stability of the atmosphere. Two tests are presented, using the scheme in a one-dimensional model: the simulation of the diurnal cycle, and the transformation of a polar air mass moving over the warm sea.",
