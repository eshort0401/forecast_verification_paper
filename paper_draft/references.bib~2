	abstract = { Abstract Kinetic energy spectra derived from observations in the free atmosphere possess a wavenumber dependence of k−3 for large scales, characteristic of 2D turbulence, and transition to a k−5/3 dependence in the mesoscale. Kinetic energy spectra computed using mesoscale and experimental near-cloud-scale NWP forecasts from the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model are examined, and it is found that the model-derived spectra match the observational spectra well, including the transition. The model spectra decay at the highest resolved wavenumbers compared with observations, indicating energy removal by the model's dissipation mechanisms. This departure from the observed spectra is used to define the model's effective resolution. Various dissipation mechanisms used in NWP models are tested in WRF model simulations to examine the mechanisms' impact on a model's effective resolution. The spinup of the spectra in forecasts is also explored, along with spectra variability in the free atmosphere and in forecasts under different synoptic regimes. },

@article{engel07,
	abstract = { Abstract This paper presents an extension of the operational consensus forecast (OCF) method, which performs a statistical correction of model output at sites followed by weighted average consensus on a daily basis. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) model forecasts are received from international centers at various temporal resolutions. As such, in order to extend the OCF methodology to hourly temporal resolution, a method is described that blends multiple models regardless of their temporal resolution. The hourly OCF approach is used to generate forecasts of 2-m air temperature, dewpoint temperature, RH, mean sea level pressure derived from the barometric pressure at the station location (QNH), along with 10-m wind speed and direction for 283 Australian sites. In comparison to a finescale hourly regional model, the hourly OCF process results in reductions in average mean square error of 47\% (air temperature), 40\% (dewpoint temperature), 43\% (RH), 29\% (QNH), 42\% (wind speed), and 11\% (wind direction) during February--March with slightly higher reductions in May. As part of the development of the approach, the systematic and random natures of hourly NWP forecast errors are evaluated and found to vary with forecast hour, with a diurnal modulation overlaying the normal error growth with time. The site-based statistical correction of the model forecasts is found to include simple statistical downscaling. As such, the method is found to be most appropriate for meteorological variables that vary systematically with spatial resolution. },

	abstract = { Abstract The objective consensus forecasting (OCF) system is an automated operational forecasting system that adapts to underlying numerical model upgrades within 30 days and generally outperforms direct model output (DMO) and model output statistics (MOS) forecasts. It employs routinely available DMO and MOS guidance combined after bias correction using a mean absolute error (MAE)-weighted average algorithm. OCF generates twice-daily forecasts of screen-level temperature maxima and minima, ground-level temperature minima, evaporation, sunshine hours, and rainfall and its probability for day 0 to day 6 for up to 600 Australian sites. Extensive real-time trials of temperature forecasts yielded MAEs at days 0--2 about 40\% lower than those from its component MOS and DMO forecasts. MAEs were also lower at day 1 than matching official forecasts of maxima and minima by 8\% and 10\% and outperformed official forecasts at over 71\% and 75\% of sites, respectively. MAEs of weighted average consensus outperformed simple average forecasts by about 5\%. },

@article{glahn72,
	abstract = { Abstract Model Output Statistics (MOS) is an objective weather forecasting technique which consists of determining a statistical relationship between a predictand and variables forecast by a numerical model at some projection time(s). It is, in effect, the determination of the ``weather related'' statistics of a numerical model. This technique, together with screening regression, has been applied to the prediction of surface wind, probability of precipitation, maximum temperature, cloud amount, and conditional probability of frozen precipitation. Predictors used include surface observations at initial time and predictions from the Subsynoptic Advection Model (SAM) and the Primitive Equation model used operationally by the National Weather Service. Verification scores have been computed, and, where possible, compared to scores for forecasts from other objective techniques and for the official forecasts. MOS forecasts of surface wind, probability of precipitation, and conditional probability of frozen precipitation are being disseminated by the National Weather Service over teletype and facsimile. It is concluded that MOS is a useful technique in objective weather forecasting. },
